# Ultrasound-Guided versus Stereotactically Navigated Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Placement: A Randomized Controlled Trial
This repository contains the analytical workflow and source code for the **Navigated Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt (NAVPS) trial**, a randomized controlled trial comparing intraoperative **ultrasound-guided (US-G)** and **stereotactically guided (ST-G)** navigation for ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement.  
The repository provides all code used for data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization supporting the findings of the study.

## Study Overview

**Purpose**
To compare surgical intervention time, accuracy, and safety between ultrasound-guided (US-G) and stereotactically guided (ST-G) ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement in adults.  
The trial aimed to determine whether US-G navigation could achieve comparable accuracy while reducing operative time relative to ST-G placement.

**Trial Design**
- **Design:** Single-centre, randomized controlled trial (1:1 allocation)  
- **Period:** February 2020 – June 2024  
- **Setting:** [Insert Hospital/Institution Name]  
- **Participants:** 134 adults undergoing VPS placement (of 153 screened)  
- **Intervention groups:**  
  - **US-G group (n = 66):** Ultrasound-guided VPS placement  
  - **ST-G group (n = 68):** Stereotactically guided VPS placement  

**Key Findings**
- Ultrasound-guided VPS placement resulted in significantly shorter surgical intervention times compared to stereotactically guided placement  
  (−11.5 minutes; 95% CI −18.5 to −4.5; *p* = 0.002).  
- Catheter placement accuracy was comparable between groups.  
- VPS dysfunction and complication rates did not differ significantly.  
- US-G placement required more ventricular puncture attempts but remained more time-efficient overall.
